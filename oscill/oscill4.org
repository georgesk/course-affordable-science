* Purpose
The program =oscill4.py= aims to give an example of how to develop a user interface for
running an experiment with expEYES-Junior (see http://expeyes.in).

Its source is part of a course named "Affordable Science Experiments";
see:

* The experiment
** Schematics
A massive object is hung under a spring. The top of the spring is tightly fixed,
and a vertical insulated wire is hung just below the massive object. The end of
this wire is unwrapped, so it acts as the cursor of a potentiometer. Eventually,
some light sheet of plastic or of metal is tightened to the massive object in
order to provide some friction while it moves in the air.

The potentiometer's body is a measuring cylinder filled with copper sulfide
($concentration = 0.01\, mol\cdot L^{-1}$), which bears two circular electrodes, made
with one turn of copper: one at the bottom of the cylinder, the other one near
the top of the copper sulfide solution. Both electrodes are connected through
insulated wires to a $4.5\, V$ battery. Whenever one connects the battery, she
should consider which electrode need to gain more copper, and connect the
negative end of the battery to this electrode (copper deposits on the cathode).

When some current flows between both electrodes, there are quite plane
equipotential surfaces, regularly spaced vertically between the electrodes. So
when the height of the vertical wire's tip movesup and down, its potential is
a linear function of its height. Figure [[fig:liquid_pot]] describes the experiment.

** Let us do it
The experiment is set up, and two wires are plugged into expEYES' slots: the
liquid cursor is connected to /A1/, the first bipolar analogic input, and the
/minus/ wire is connected to /GND/, ground of the computer.

We must take care to limit the voltage applied to the cylinder, in order to
prevent voltages higher than 5 V.

Then, we launch the application =oscill4.py= (command line = =python3 oscill4.py=),
and we click on the /Wake up/ button. We slowly pull the pendulum far from its
equilibrium position, and we release it suddenly. Data sampling should begin
precisely at this moment, and we should see the curve plotted while the pendulum
keeps oscillating.

If data sampling starts too quickly, we can lower the sensibility to start
signal by dragging the /Threshold/ slider to the right.

When the curve is completely plotted, we can save the data (/Save/ button) or fit
them against a mathematical model (/Fit/ button).

* The user interface

The figure [[fig:oscill_monitor]] displays the user interface as it appears inside
the authoring program (=designer=). We shall discuss the methods attached to all
user-level action widgets.

** Menus and submenus
*** File \rightarrow Quit
To close the main window.
*** File \rightarrow Save
To save current data to a text file, whose name can be changed [[Button "Save"][below]], ubder the
plot area.
***  Help \rightarrow Manual
To read the present help file.
*** Help \rightarrow About
To read license stuff.
*** Button "Wake Up"
Prepares the program for a new experiment. The data acquisition will begin as
the input signal's /slew rate/ becomes greater that a given threshold, which can
be set with the "Threshold" slider described [[a:threshold][below]].
*** Button "Stop"
This button can be used in the /immediate/ mode described [[a:radio_buttons][below]]. It stops data
gathering, so the program can be activated for a new experiment after.
*** Text input "Duration"
You can type a number of seconds, which will be the scheduled duration of the
next experiment; plots are resized while one is modifying the duration.
*** Button "Save"
To save current data to a text file, whose name can be modified just near the
button. The data are written as lines containing a timestamp and a voltage
value, units are second and volt. Numbers areseparated by plain spaces.
*** Radio buttons: "immediate" and "finally"
#+NAME: a:radio_buttons
When the button "immediate" is checked, the plot will be updated as fast as data
are coming from the experiment, in near-real time. When the button "finally" is
checked, data are first measured and finally their curve is plotted.

The /immediate/ mode is enforced if the experiment's duration is greater than
3.5 s; the /finally/ mode is enforced if the experiment's duration is shorter than
0.5 s.

*** Slider "Threshold"
#+NAME: a:threshold
This slider provides an opportunity to tune the sensitivity of the detection for
the start of experiment. When the /Wake up/ button has been clicked, the
experiment's data will be gathered as soon as they begin to change quick
enough. If one selects a high slew rate, the start detection is less sensitive;
on the contrary, if the selected slew rate is zero, the start detection is quite
inactive, and measurements begin right after the click on the /Wake up/ button.

*** Button "Fit"
To compare measurements with a mathematic model for a damped sine wave. Here is
the formula used to fit data:
$$A*\sin(2\pi ft+\phi)*e^{-D*t}+C$$
where $A$ is the amplitude (V), $f$ is the frequency (Hz), $\phi$ is a phase, $D$
is the damping factor ($s^{-1}$), and $C$ is an additive constant value, the DC component
of the signal.

Some authors prefer consider $\tau = \frac{1}{D}$ with unit $s$, which is the
"relaxation time" of the decay. The amplitude of the signal is divided by two
when $t\simeq0.69\tau$.

When the button is clicked, parameters are optimized to make a model as near as
possible from the measured data; the formula is displaid near the /Fit/ button,
and curves coming from the model are plotted in addition to the data's plot.
